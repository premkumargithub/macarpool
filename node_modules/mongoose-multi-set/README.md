Mongoose Multi Set Plugin
==========================

Simple plugin for [Mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose) that allows you to do:
```javascript
	user.multiSet(req.query, ['username', 'age', 'name']);
```
instead of
```javascript
	user.username = req.query.username;
	user.age = req.query.age;
	user.name = req.query.name;
```

Useful when you want to set more values in the model at once.
The plugin doesn't interfere with the validation rules in the model, unlike the Model.update() function or the Schema.findByIdAndUpdate(). This plugin doesn't save the model either,
this is the job of the calling code.


## Installation

`npm install mongoose-multi-set --save`

## Usage

model.multiSet(`{object}`, `[allowed fields]`, `ignoreMissing`);

Where `{object}` is an object like {field1: value1, field2: value2,...} with fields to set and their values.

`[allowed fields]` is an array of fields from the `{object}` that are allowed to be set in the model.

`ignoreMissing` an optional boolean to either skip over undefined values or force set the model fields to undefined. Defaults to true (skip/do nothing for undefined values).
This could be useful when you're modifying an existing model - setting some fields to undefined or leaving them unaltered.

You'd use this plugin to update the model from, say, req.query, when you have proper validation in place.

```javascript
var UserSchema = new Schema({
    username: String,
    name: String,
    age: Number
});
UserSchema.plugin(require('mongoose-multi-set'));
var User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
User.findById('1234', function(err, user) {
	// say req.query is {username: 'Foo', name: 'Bar', age: 25}
	user.multiSet(req.query, ['username', 'age']);
	user.save(function(err) {
		handleValidationErrors(err);
	});
});
```
The User model will now have the `username` and `age` properties set from req.query.

 - The plugin doesn't let you update the `id` or `_id` properties of the model. If you really want to update the id of the model, you can do so manually ;)
 - The `[allowed fields]` parameter is required to make sure only the desired fields are updated.
